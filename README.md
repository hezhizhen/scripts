# scripts

## Installation

To use these scripts:

1. clone this repository to somewhere like `~`
2. add the directory to `$PATH`
   1. zsh: `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/scripts' >> .zshrc`
   2. fish: `echo 'set PATH $PATH ~/scripts' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish`

## Troubleshooting

1. If some scripts couldn't be executed, run `chmod +x <script>` to grant execution permission.

## FAQ

1. `.sh` suffixes are preserved to avoid naming conflicts.
